1) Open renderer.pde in Processing
2) Run it. It should throw an error along the lines of.
  "java.lang.ClassCastException: renderer cannot be cast to processing.core.PApplet
    at processing.core.PApplet.main(PApplet.java:6486)"
3) Go to "File"->"Export Application" and export a linux application.
4) Run processing.py. If three images appear in the same directory as processing.py, everything is working.
5) You can delete those images. They don't do anything important. You'll need the "render" command exported by Processing.
